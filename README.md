Memory Cards – Professional README 
Memory Cards is a lightweight, dependency-free application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that lets you create, view, and persist flash cards (front/back) directly in the browser using localStorage. The project embraces a concise tech stack—HTML for structure, CSS for clean styling, and JavaScript for the card logic and persistence—while remaining approachable for beginners and flexible enough for future enhancements. The core philosophy is to provide a fast, offline-capable tool for building and reviewing simple memorization cards without requiring a server or external services.

Overview
The application presents users with a minimal, distraction-free interface where you can enter a card’s front (the prompt or question) and back (the answer or content) through a straightforward form. Cards appear in a responsive grid, making it easy to skim a collection of items on any screen size. Each card supports per-item actions—view details, and delete—with these actions placed close to the card to optimize the user experience. All data is stored locally in the browser to ensure privacy and offline accessibility. This persistence is achieved via a dedicated localStorage key named memoryCards_v1. Upon loading the page, the app reads from localStorage, reconstructs any previously saved cards, and renders them into the UI to provide a seamless continue-from-last-session experience.

How to Run Locally
Open index.html in your preferred browser (no server is required). Use the form to create new cards. Each submission appends the new card to an in-memory array and persists the updated collection to localStorage automatically.
To reset the stored data, delete the memoryCards_v1 key from localStorage or implement a dedicated reset mechanism in the UI (not included in the initial version).

Data Model and Persistence
Storage key: memoryCards_v1
In-memory structure: an array named cards that holds card objects
Serialization: JSON.stringify(cards) converts the array to a JSON string for storage
Deserialization: JSON.parse(data) converts the stored string back into an array on load
Lifecycle: on every add/delete operation, the app updates the cards array and writes the new JSON string to localStorage; on page load, it reads from localStorage and renders the cards.


How to Create a Card
The interface provides a form with two fields: Front (the prompt or question) and Back (the answer or content). Submit the form to create a new card. The card is immediately added to the in-memory list and persisted to localStorage. The newly created card appears in the grid alongside existing cards and is fully interactive.

Card Interactions
View Details: Expand or reveal additional information about a card as needed.
Delete: Remove a card from the grid and from localStorage.
All actions are designed to be intuitive and accessible, with keyboard and mouse interactions supported.

Design and Accessibility
The UI uses a clean, minimal aesthetic with responsive CSS Grid to adapt to various screen sizes.
Accessible controls and clear labeling aim to support keyboard navigation and screen readers.
The codebase is organized to be approachable for contributors while remaining compact.

Usage Tips and Limitations
No backend server is required; everything runs in the browser. LocalStorage is limited by browser quotas; for very large collections, consider implementing an export/import workflow. If you reset the data, all cards will be lost; you can implement a dedicated reset button in a future iteration or manually clear localStorage.

Potential Enhancements (Future Ideas)
Add search and filter capabilities to quickly locate cards.Implement editing capabilities for existing cards.Introduce tagging, categories, or a Leitner-style spaced repetition system.

Provide export/import options (JSON/CSV) for cross-device syncing.
Add user preferences (themes, card density, font size) and accessibility improvements.
